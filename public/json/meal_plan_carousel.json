            "description": "Eating in season is the best way to ensure your food is at its best. Fall's cooler temperatures call for heartier, warmer options. Slow Cooker Coconut Curry is a perfect Monday recipe–it's easy and you'll have plenty of leftovers. Our Cranberry And Brie Crescent Ring could be the star of any autumn party, especially when served alongside Upside-Down Apple Cake. We recommend pairing the Hearty Vegetable Stew with Dutch Oven Jalapeño Cheddar Bread. Finally, why wait for Thanksgiving to make Festive Stuffed Butternut Squash?",
